Testing Notes
-------------

-   If testing locally, don't forget to accept the self-signed keys by visiting
    BigTent directly!

-   Yahoo's OpenID implementation remembers approval and keeps you logged in.
    There's no checkbox to avoid this.

    To reset, visit Yahoo's [Manage App and Website
    Connections](https://api.login.yahoo.com/WSLogin/V1/unlink) page and click
    "Remove" next to the entry for BigTent.
